## soapui-raml-plugin

- Allows you to import RAML files into SoapUI for testing your REST APIs
- Allows you to generate a REST Mock Service for a RAML file being imported
- Allows you to udpate an existing REST Service in SoapUI from a RAML file
- Allows you to generate a RAML file for any REST API defined in SoapUI


-> See the [blog-post](http://olensmar.blogspot.se/2013/12/a-raml-apihub-plugin-for-soapui.html) for a detailed overview.

### Download & Install

As of the 1.2 version the plugin is only available via the Plugin Repository / Plugin Manager button in top 
toolbars of either SoapUI Pro 5.1+ or Ready! API 1.0+

### Build it yourself

Clone the Git repository, make sure you have maven installed, and run

```
mvn clean install assembly:single
```
### Features and shortcomings

The RAML importer supports most constructs in the [RAML 0.8 specification](http://raml.org/spec.html), including
parameterized traits and resourceTypes, !include statements, child resources, query/header/form/uri parameters,
example requests bodies, etc.

Currently ignored are:
- security declarations - mainly because SoapUI doesn't support OAuth yet
- protocols - not sure how that would be mapped to SoapUI where you can add as many endpoints as needed
- schemas - the SoapUI API doesn't make them easy to add programmatically, and it only supports XML Schema for now

I've tested this with a number of RAML files (see src/test/resources and the RamlImporterTests),
but I'm sure there are details I've missed - please let me know if you find anything strange or unexpected.
